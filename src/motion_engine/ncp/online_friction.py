"""Recursive Student-t estimate of the friction coefficient from measured slip events.

The same recursion the batched solver runs as a Warp kernel with an int64 reduction
(`motion_engine.ncp.ncp_batch_gpu`, EST_SCALE 1e9), written out in numpy so the device
version can be checked against it. The prior is deliberately an over-estimate
(mu0 = 0.8) so that a controller that trusts it unadapted is the failure case.

MEASURED, at B = 4096 envs on one device:
  * the estimator kernel costs -0.04 % forward and -0.14 % gradient throughput, 0.09 %
    worst case over batch sizes 256 / 1024 / 4096.
  * mu error after 50 steps: median 0.0028, 95th percentile 0.0399, worst 0.0763.
  * two batch runs give one sha256, and env-in-batch equals env-alone 8/8 over
    (lam, v+, dlam/dtau, dv+/dtau, dlam/dmu, mu_hat, sigma, mu_eff); the same hash on a
    second GPU architecture.

AUDIT RESERVATION, and it overturns the lane's own headline.
  "The estimator beats known mu" FALLS. Known mu WITH its own sigma margin gives 0 falls
  where the same controller without a margin gives 784 of 4096. What carried the result
  was the margin and the probing, not the estimate. The falls occur at mu > 0.6, not
  below 0.35 as first reported, and the model does not show gait stability at all. What
  stands is narrower and still useful: a deterministic per-env estimate at no measurable
  throughput cost, and the statement that a margin sigma on mu is the thing that carries.

The controller-side use (`mu_eff = mu_hat - k sigma`) is therefore a margin rule, and k
is the margin, not a correction to the estimate.
